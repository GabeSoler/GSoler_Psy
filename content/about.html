    <h1>My life story...</h1>
    <p>I am from Chile, a place many people in Europe seem to feel exotic. I have the rare condition of inheriting two european passports, Spanish and Italian, from my two grandmothers. In the context of the Chilean dictatorship these passports where a of high value and they where used by some of my family members.</p>
    <p>Being multinational has been part of my life, but at the same time, it was a far away thing as I was growing up. I always felt I was not going to travel away from Chile, until I decided to move to Scotland to pursue further studies</p>
    <p>Life in Chile was not easy, and the things we lived as normal are sometimes shocking for people at this side of the world. Having a extremely violent dictatorship the first seven years of my life left a mark in me and I  could see that mark in the people around me</p>
    <p>Fear was a comon emotion, fear of talking with others too much, fear of staying out until late, fear of the police officers, fear of walking alone</p>
    <p>Some therapist work with trauma as if it is something irrational, I sadly desagree. When you have lived traumatic experiences it is a reality that goes inside your bones, and it is not that easy to work it out</p>
    <p>I was a curious and explorative child, from early age a bit more conerned with ideas, art and spirituality than the 'worldly' things. I was prone to ask difficult cuestions in my catholic primary like 'what is the sex of God?', or 'when monkies will evolve as humans?'</p>
    <p>My curiosity for other people showed also at early age, to the point that a neighbour would prefer to walk a bit longer than answer my questions when he was arriving home. That gave me the nick name of 'the why' in my streets, as I would ask eveyone details of why they where doing whatever they where doing</p>
    <p>Having a nickname and knowing my curiosity was annoying made me stop asking too many questions to people, but at that time I was learning to read, so books where my new source of exploration</p>
    <p>Around eight I made my first acrilic painting, which my grandmother stores as a little treasure. I was fascinated by colour from early age and painting and drawing where a safe space for me. At school I would draw to relax and to avoid talking to people and get called off</p>
    <p>Why telling this things about me? Because these are some of the traits I bring with me. A relationship with politics and systemic trauma, curiosity about people why people do what they do, and a intense interest for arts and creativity</p>
    <p>Those traits have been there from early childhood, but I have not always loved my own particular way of being in the world. Quite early I understood what bullying meant and how much it hursts to be dicriminated.</p>
    <p>Even now sometimes I struggle showing these traits to people, because in a 'macho' culture being curious and sensitive where not appreciated, at least not as a good thing</p>
    <p>I felt different from so early that I lernt to hide, and to mask. I started wondering how to be like the other kids and tried to be someone else</p>
    <p>Nowadays we have a name for this things: Neurodiversity. I prefer to not put myself in one category, but I know my traits have been slighly different from forever: school was easy intelectually but so hard socialy</p>
    <p>I felt lonely inside until I found a friedn with whom I could talk abstractly, and slowly I started to find people who also where sensitive and more abstract</p>
    <p>Stydiyng psychology was such a treat for me, as I had the chance to learn all the different approaches and ideas about the human mind, however things did not get too easy as I had a mental health crisis mid way through</p>
    <p>How could I have been a therapist if all the trauma acumulated from childhood would not have popped out? I propably would have been an academic actually.</p>
    <p>I think that having a crisis and needing to go through different specialist showed me so much about being fragile, suffering, the limitations of the profession and also its wonders. There was so much I did not even imagine before, and so much to do.</p>
    <p>After coming back and finishing psychology I continued studying and seeing clients, as some sort of indivisible path that lead to my PhD in Edinburgh.</p>
    <p>Here I was able to develop my intuitions and ideas in a way I never could before. Having two scholarships that covered my fees and mantainanace I had time to study, do art, explore as much as I wanted.</p>
    <p>And that lead me to new insights and theories about what it means to be human. I realised we are creative beings who live between two realms, the inner world of intensities, arts and dreams and the world of objects, machines and clear measurments.</p>
    <p>This space between I call Transitional, the space of play, culture, imagination and the creation of professions and arts. It is from a place of understanging our fragility and our beauty that making therapy makes sense, a dance between madness and beauty, pain and growth</p>
